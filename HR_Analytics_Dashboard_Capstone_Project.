Capstone Project Report
Project Title: Human Resources Analytics Dashboard for
Workforce Performance and Retention
Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project is to design and develop an interactive HR analytics dashboard that provides
insights into employee performance, attrition, and workforce trends to support strategic HR
decision-making.
• Collect and clean HR data related to employee demographics, performance, and turnover.
• Design a structured data model suitable for workforce analytics.
• Develop interactive dashboards displaying KPIs such as attrition rate, employee satisfaction,
and performance ratings.
• Analyze trends related to employee retention and workforce productivity.
• Provide actionable insights to support data-driven HR decisions.
Why the Topic
Workforce management is a critical component of organizational success. Many organizations
struggle with employee turnover and performance monitoring due to fragmented data systems. This
project applies Business Intelligence techniques to transform raw HR data into meaningful insights
through visualization and dashboards.
Problem Solved
Organizations often manage HR data across multiple spreadsheets and systems, making analysis
time-consuming and inefficient. Decision-makers lack real-time insights into attrition trends,
workforce distribution, and performance metrics. This project consolidates HR data into a
centralized interactive dashboard, providing real-time KPIs and visual insights that improve
transparency, efficiency, and strategic workforce planning
